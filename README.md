# (Kernel) Logistic Regression

We first derive and implement Newton algorithm for logistic regression. Then the algorithm is tested on [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data set using two strategies:  
* One-vs-All strategy
* One-vs-One strategy
Results are summarized in a write-up.

Next, we  derive and implement kernel binary logistic regression, and test it on "cat" and "dog" classes of [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data set. Results are summarized in a write-up.
